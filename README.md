# 🔐 Security Architecture: Authorization & Privacy Design

This project demonstrates the design of a secure authorization model and a privacy-preserving architecture for modern organizations.

It is based on real-world security principles used in IAM (Identity & Access Management) and GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance).

---

## 🏢 Scenario

A company manages highly sensitive data, including:

* Financial reports
* Payroll information
* Employee records

The organization must ensure that:

* Only authorized users can access specific resources
* Sensitive data is protected from misuse or unauthorized exposure
* User privacy is preserved while maintaining business functionality

This project addresses these challenges by designing:

* A secure authorization model
* A privacy-first system architecture

---

## 🚀 Key Concepts

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
* Least Privilege
* Separation of Duties
* Privacy by Design
* GDPR / CCPA Compliance

---

## 🏗️ Part 1 — Authorization Model

A hybrid RBAC + ABAC model was designed to control access to sensitive company resources.

### Highlights:

* Defined users, roles, and permissions
* Designed an access control matrix
* Enforced least privilege
* Implemented separation of duties
* Simulated using SQL

📄 See: `docs/authorization-model.md`

---

## 🕵️ Part 2 — Privacy Architecture

A privacy-first architecture was designed to reduce tracking and protect user identity.

### Highlights:

* Compared tracking methods (cookies, fingerprinting, IP tracking)
* Designed anonymization and tokenization layers
* Minimized data collection
* Integrated compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA)

📄 See: `docs/privacy-architecture.md`

## 🛠️ Simulations

* SQL role-based access control
* Permission management examples

## 🎯 Real-World Relevance

This project reflects real-world security challenges:

* Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data
* Protecting user identity and privacy
* Designing systems aligned with compliance frameworks

These concepts are directly applicable to:

* AWS IAM
* Keycloak / OAuth2 / OIDC
* Spring Security (RBAC)
